Autonomous tracker of the AI/ML security frontier — local & self-hosted model stacks, LLM
red teaming, AI supply-chain security, AI-assisted offense/defense, and AI security
standards — curated for a red team operator working with local models. Derived from
[TRENDS.md](TRENDS.md); regenerated on every scan.

## How it works

A scheduled routine runs a fixed prompt: *read `AGENTS.md`, then `routines/daily.md`, and
execute it.* The agent sweeps the sources in [`SOURCES.md`](SOURCES.md), routes new
published artifacts into the [trend ledger](TRENDS.md), writes a dated report under
[`reports/`](reports/), regenerates this page, and commits. A weekly routine recalibrates
trends and prunes.

This is a **radar**: it points to published research, tools, and advisories and summarizes
their significance. It tracks artifacts — it is not a runbook and stores no operational
payloads or jailbreak strings.
